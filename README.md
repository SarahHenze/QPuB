## QPuB - Quantification of peptide using Bayesian inference

   QPuB employs Bayesian statistical inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to learn the posterior distributions of the converison factors for peptide products. 
   
* **Execution**

  In order to run QPuB, users are strongly advised to install **R** with version **3.5.0** or above along with the dependencies mentioned below.  
  
  Execution of QPuB proceeds through two simple steps
  
    * manually download the package and unzip the file in your local computer
    
    * after changing the working directory to **QPuB** sub-folder, run the following command from the terminal 
    
    ```R
       Rscript runQPuB.r -fol <INPUT FOLDER> -pf input.txt -tim <file contains timepoints> -titr <file contains titration>
  
   ```
  
 * **Examples**
  
      The **examples** folder contains two toy examples of endopeptidase digestion. 
      
      In order to run the examples, execute the following command for a date without noise 
      
     ```R
      Rscript runQPuB.r -fol examples/toy_endo3_nonoise -pf input.txt 
     ```
     and 
     
      ```R
      Rscript runQPuB.r -fol examples/toy_endo3_nonoise -pf input.txt 
     ```
     for the data with noise
